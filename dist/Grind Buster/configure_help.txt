Sleep range also acts as a wait timer for users with a slow internet connection to allow for the next round to load in the browser.

Skills: Set all hotkey skills in the skills section for the grind buster to use. 

Premium: Premium skills are skills that will be activated when channelling is active. This will allow for supporting skills to be activated for free and have double the duration.
